# Soldering
different soldering techniques
we want paste
reflow oven
stencil

pick n place (image)

# EDA
circuit design

simulations (briefly)

## schematic
good practices
  mark unusued pins
  nets and labels
  vcc on top, gnd on bot
  organize in sections
  left to right flow

footprints
layout
routing
